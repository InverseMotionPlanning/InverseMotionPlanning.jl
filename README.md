# InverseTAMP.jl

Inverse task-and-motion-planning (TAMP) in Julia. 

(The "task" part isn't implemented yet.)

## Setup

Enter `Pkg` mode in the Julia REPL by pressing `]`, then run:

```
instantiate
```

to install all required dependencies.

## Usage

The top-level script is `main.jl`, which can be executed line-by-line in your editor of choice (Julia for VSCode is recommended.)

In the future this will be turned into a Julia package that supports precompilation, etc.
